 * Note values are assigned by where they appear on the

 * In order to get C#/Db (i.e., number 1 on the "clock")
 * an alteration is needed to change its value.
 * For example, D = 2. If we want D#(3), we go to
 * the Alteration enum and add a sharp, or "shift" of +1,
 * in order to attain the value 3 on the "clock."
 * If you don't understand what I mean by the 12-tone clock,
 * find a clock and write the corresponding Note letters
 * as listed below next to the numbers of the clock.
 * Or use Google.
