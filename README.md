#How to use
1. Select how many different voices total you want in your exercise with the "Number of Voices" (i.e., how many notes to play at the same time).
2. Select how long you want the exercise to be using the "Exercise Length" slider at the bottom.
3. Select tempo, or how fast, to play the exercise in BPM (Beats per minute).
4. Click the "New Exercise" button to generate a new ear training exercise.
5. Click the "Play Exercise" button to play the exercise. Guess the notes as you hear them, write them on staff paper, or try to play them on a piano. Hit "Play Exercise" as many times as you need it, this isn't a race! Use the "Play Middle C" button for a reference if you need it.
6. Click "Reveal Answer" to check if you're right.

Enjoy!
